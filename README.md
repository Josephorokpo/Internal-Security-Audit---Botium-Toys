# Internal-Security-Audit---Botium-Toys
Security Controls &amp; Compliance Audit - Botium Toys

## Project Introduction

This project involved conducting a comprehensive cybersecurity controls and compliance checklist audit for Botium Toys. The primary objective was to systematically evaluate the organization's adherence to established security best practices and regulatory requirements across critical operational areas. By identifying existing control implementations and specific compliance gaps, this audit provides actionable insights to fortify Botium Toys' defenses and ensure robust data protection.

## Methodology and Evaluation

The audit was executed using a structured controls and compliance checklist, meticulously developed based on industry-recognized cybersecurity frameworks and principles (e.g., elements from NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001 principles, and considerations for data privacy regulations like GDPR/PCI DSS where applicable to the identified sensitive data types).

For each control point on the checklist, an evaluation was performed to determine its current implementation status and effectiveness. This involved:

Reviewing existing documentation (policies, procedures).

Observing operational practices and system configurations.

Conducting targeted inquiries with relevant personnel.

Evaluation was conducted using a simple yes/no checklist for each control, assessing its presence, proper configuration, and operational effectiveness. Each "No" response was accompanied by a detailed explanation that articulated the specific security gap identified and the proposed control to address it. These identified deficiencies directly translated into compliance gaps and security risks, forming the basis for subsequent recommendations.

## Conclusion

### Overall Recommendation:

To significantly enhance Botium Toys' security posture and mitigate critical risks, it is imperative to implement a holistic set of foundational security controls. This includes fortifying **access management** through Least Privilege and Segregation of Duties, deploying comprehensive **encryption** for sensitive data, establishing a centralized **password management system** with strong policies, integrating an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for proactive threat detection, developing and testing robust **Disaster Recovery plans**, and formalizing **legacy system management**.

These comprehensive control implementations are crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring business continuity. Moreover, a foundational **asset classification** initiative is essential to identify any additional necessary controls, thereby enabling a robust, risk-based approach to security that ensures adherence to regulatory obligations and strengthens overall data protection and compliance.
